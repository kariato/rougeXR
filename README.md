# rougeXR
A webxr version of rouge

Based on [Davidslv/rogue (Rogue 5.4.4)](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue), initially pinned to `f4653c2a2ee6981a73abe9dfda055134285e1e79`.

Development starts in a regular desktop browser with keyboard and mouse controls, a 2D dungeon view, and a state inspector. Desktop 3D follows; XR is added after the game can be debugged without a headset.

Current implementation: Phase 8 is underway through healing and timed recovery. Inventory, equipment, food and hunger now share the deterministic turn engine. The source `doctor` daemon heals from saved quiet-turn state, regeneration rings add healing, combat interrupts quiet time, and blindness/confusion recovery uses serializable scheduler effects.
