# rougeXR
A webxr version of rouge

Based on [Davidslv/rogue (Rogue 5.4.4)](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue), initially pinned to `f4653c2a2ee6981a73abe9dfda055134285e1e79`.

Development starts in a regular desktop browser with keyboard and mouse controls, a 2D dungeon view, and a state inspector. Desktop 3D follows; XR is added after the game can be debugged without a headset.

Current implementation: Phase 8 is underway. Its first slice resolves movement's deferred pickup hook, collects gold exactly once into the purse, enforces the source's 23-slot pack accounting for ordinary items, and exposes browser pickup through the comma key and button. Phase 7 combat and deterministic replay remain active in the browser encounter.
