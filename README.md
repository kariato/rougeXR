# rougeXR
A webxr version of rouge

Based on [Davidslv/rogue (Rogue 5.4.4)](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue), initially pinned to `f4653c2a2ee6981a73abe9dfda055134285e1e79`.

Development starts in a regular desktop browser with keyboard and mouse controls, a 2D dungeon view, and a state inspector. Desktop 3D follows; XR is added after the game can be debugged without a headset.

Current implementation: Phase 8 is underway through equipment. Gold pickup, source-style pack accounting, stack split/merge, browser inventory and drop controls, weapon/armor equip and removal, curse restrictions, and equipment combat modifiers now run through the deterministic engine. Phase 7 combat and replay remain active in the browser encounter.
