# rougeXR
A webxr version of rouge

Based on [Davidslv/rogue (Rogue 5.4.4)](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue), initially pinned to `f4653c2a2ee6981a73abe9dfda055134285e1e79`.

Development starts in a regular desktop browser with keyboard and mouse controls, a 2D dungeon view, and a state inspector. Desktop 3D follows; XR is added after the game can be debugged without a headset.

Current implementation: Phase 6 adds versioned manual JSON saves, validated atomic restore, canonical SHA-256 state hashes, and deterministic replay bug reports to the walkable browser fixture. Save state preserves pending haste slots, scheduler/RNG state, knowledge, and counters; imported replay reports reproduce each recorded action checksum before replacing the live session.
